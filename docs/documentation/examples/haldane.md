## The Haldane model

The Haldane Hamiltonian is a single-orbital tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice with a sublattice-staggered
on-site potential (orbital mass) and complex hoppings between next-nearest-neighbor sites that produce a staggered
magnetic field configuration with vanishing total flux through the unit cell [^1].

This model describes a Chern insulator (or a quantum anomalous Hall insulator) because it hosts an integer quantum Hall effect
in the absence of any applied external magnetic fields. This characteristic makes Haldane model ideal for illustrating another capability of KITE: the calculation of transverse conductivities reflecting the quantum geometry of wavefunctions [^2] [^3].

Let us use KITE to compute the dc conductivity tensor of the Haldane model. 
_The full script for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/quantum-kite/kite/blob/313a00e54a9f9aa33b22886eaf97ce62aaec3996/examples/dos_dccond_haldane.py)._

### Lattice
Let us begin with the definition of the Hamiltonian for the case of purely imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hoppings:

``` python linenums="1"
def haldane(onsite=(0, 0), t=1):
    """Return lattice specification for Haldane model"""

    # parameters
    a = 0.24595  # [nm] unit cell length
    a_cc = 0.142  # [nm] carbon-carbon distance
    t2 = t/10

    # define lattice vectors
    a1 = a * np.array([1, 0])
    a2 = a * np.array([1 / 2, 1 / 2 * np.sqrt(3)])

    # create a lattice with 2 primitive vectors
    lat = pb.Lattice(a1=a1, a2=a2)

    # add sublattices
    lat.add_sublattices(
        # name, position, and onsite potential
        ('A', [0, -a_cc/2], onsite[0]),
        ('B', [0,  a_cc/2], onsite[1])
    )

    # Add hoppings
    lat.add_hoppings(
        # inside the main cell, between which atoms, and the value
        ([0,  0], 'A', 'B', -t),
        # between neighboring cells, between which atoms, and the value
        ([1, -1], 'A', 'B', -t),
        ([0, -1], 'A', 'B', -t),
        ([1, 0], 'A', 'A', -t2 * 1j),
        ([0, -1], 'A', 'A', -t2 * 1j),
        ([-1, 1], 'A', 'A', -t2 * 1j),
        ([1, 0], 'B', 'B', -t2 * -1j),
        ([0, -1], 'B', 'B', -t2 * -1j),
        ([-1, 1], 'B', 'B', -t2 * -1j)
    )
    return lat
```

## KITEx part
### Settings
The following explains the steps to calculate the Hall conductivity.
The first step is to define `#!python kite.configuration`, as explained in [Settings][settings]. For example,

``` python
configuration = kite.Configuration(
divisions=[2, 2],
length=[128, 128],
boundaries=['periodic', 'periodic'],
is_complex=True,
precision=0,
spectrum_range=[-10, 10]
)
```

Then, we can set `#!python kite.calculation`. We note that the the post-processing tool uses the energy spectrum limits in the HDF file (`#!python [-10,10]` in the example above) to perform the integration over the energy of occupied states.


``` python
calculation.conductivity_dc(num_points=1000,
                            num_moments=256,
                            num_random=50,
                            num_disorder=1,
                            direction='xy',
                            temperature=0.05)
```

### Disorder
We can include [different types of disorder][disorder].
For simplicity, we consider onsite uniform disorder distribution with width of `#!python 0.4` and zero average onsite energy (Anderson disorder):

``` python
disorder = kite.Disorder(lattice)
disorder.add_disorder('A', 'Uniform', +0.0, 0.4)
disorder.add_disorder('B', 'Uniform', +0.0, 0.4)
```

### Calculation and post-processing

Export the KITE model to an HDF file as costumary (see Sec. [Calculation][calculation]) and run the [KITEx][kitex] program.

This is a _full spectral_ calculation where KITEx calculates the coefficients of the Chebyshev expansion and KITE-tools
uses those moments to retrieve the transverse conductivity over the full energy range.
Both `#!python temperature` and `#!python num_points` are parameters used by KITE-tools and is possible to modify
them without running KITEx again.
This type of calculation typically requires more RAM memory than DOS or single-shot DC conductivity,
which imposes limitations to the sizes of the systems (that still can reach large scales with available memory).
This has implications for the stochastic trace evaluation (STE) done by KITE, whose relative error typically scales with $1/\sqrt{N_R D}$  (here, 
$N_R$ is the number of random vectors and $D$ is the total number of sites). The STE errors 
 can thus be significant, especially at large Chebyshev orders (required to achieve fine energy resolutions). More generally, the relative error of the STE also depends on the lattice model, type of disorder and the calculated quantities.
Transverse conductivities have more fluctuations, at least in part of the spectrum outside the topological gap, and this tutorial illustrates this issue.

Figure 1 below shows the longitudinal and transverse conductivity for a small lattice of Haldane model in a calculation that took only 3 minutes on a standard laptop.
KITEx captures the anomalous quantum Hall plateau extremely well, with a relative error of less than 0.1%.
But it is also clear that the transverse conductivity presents significantly more fluctuations outside the plateau than the longitudinal conductivity, and we already considered 50 random vectors. 
Better results can be easily obtained by running the simulation for larger systems and/or increasing the number of random vectors used in the STE (see below).

This figure can be reproduced using KITE-tools while specifying some additional parameters (refer to the [post-processing tools documentation](../postprocessing.md) if you need more details). To this end, run the following line

``` bash
./build/KITE-tools haldane.h5 --CondDC -F -4 4 1000
```

which calculates the DC conductivity for 1000 equidistant Fermi energies in the range `#!python [-4, 4]`.
The result can be plotted by using the minimal python script below.
This script can be easily modified to plot both the longitudinal and transverse conductivity on one figure. 

### Visualisation
``` python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.loadtxt('condDC.dat')
plt.plot(data[:,0], data[:,1])
plt.show()
```

<div>
  <figure>
    <img src="../../../assets/images/haldane/cond.png" style="width: 40em;" />
    <figcaption> </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

We now focus on strategies to decrease the fluctuations.
Depending on the computational resources, one possibility is increasing the system size.
It is also possible to increase the number of random vectors.
This is illustrated in Fig. 2.

  <figure>
    <img src="../../../assets/images/haldane/trans_cond.png" style="width: 40em;" />
    <figcaption> </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

Finally, there are other ways of damping the STE fluctuations, e.g. via a simple thermal averaging effect (temperature) or the use of uncorrelated disorder.
The use of such strategies depend on the goals of the numerical calculation.
In the present case, where we primarily wanted to see the quantum anomalous Hall plateau, we can simply consider a moderate Anderson disorder and work with intermediate temperatures.
