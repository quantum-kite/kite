This set of examples is designed to be illustrative but not exhaustive.
The aim is to demonstrate how KITE can be used to calculate electronic properties of well-studied 2D materials to
allow easy comparison with recent literature.
There is also a broad range of examples in KITE's repository folder that illustrate KITE's functionalities across a
wide range of tight-binding systems from simple square lattices to 3D lattice models displaying Weyl
semi-metallic phases.  

## Running all the examples

To calculate all the examples, run the [`#!python run_all_examples.py`][python-script] script from
the [`#!bash kite/exampels/`][examples-folder]-folder with

``` bash
python -m run_all_examples.py
```
