This set of examples is designed to be illustrative but not exhaustive. They do not cover all scripts that can be found in KITE examples folder but they give an in-depth perspective on how to build a script with a given functionality and analyse the results.

The on-line documentation provided here focuses on well-studied 2D materials to
allow easy comparison with recent literature.
There is also a broad range of examples in KITE's repository folder that illustrate KITE's functionalities across a
wide range of tight-binding systems from simple square lattices to 3D lattice models displaying Weyl
semi-metallic phases.  

### Running all the examples

To run all the examples at once, run the [`#!python run_all_examples.py`][python-script] script from
the [`#!bash kite/examples/`][examples-folder]-folder with

``` bash
python -m run_all_examples.py
```
