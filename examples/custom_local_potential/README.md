!!! Info

    This file describes the contents of the
    [`#!bash kite/examples/custom_local_potential/`][examples-clp-github]-folder.

This example shows how to use the custom local potential functionality in KITE. 

Begin by defining the local energy function that you want to use.
This is a function that takes as arguments the position ($x$, $y$) (in 2D) or ($x$, $y$, $z$) (in 3D) and
orbital `#!python "orb"` and returns the value of the local energy at that position and orbital.
This function is defined by the user in a simple cpp file `#!bash aux.cpp`, which is then compiled into a
shared library to be used by KITE `#!bash libaux.so.1`.
To force KITE to use the function defined by the user, the file `#!bash /lib/libaux.so.1` should be replaced by
our custom shared library, and the flag `#!python custom_local=True` must be used in the Python configuration script.
By default, this flag is set to `#!python False`. 

## 1. Compiling and replacing the default library
Begin by compiling the c++ file into a shared library by executing the following lines:

``` bash
g++ -Wall -fPIC -c aux.cpp
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libaux.so.1 -o libaux.so aux.o
```

The first line compiles the `#!bash aux.cpp` file and the second generates the shared library from the compiled object.
Next, replace the default shared library file in the `#!bash /lib` folder by the library that we just built:

``` bash
rm ../../lib/libaux.so.1
cp libaux.so ../../lib/libaux.so.1
```

The file `#!bash libaux.so.1` is the file that KITE will search for.
Now, the next time that KITE runs, it will use the library we just built.

## 2. Running the example
The rest proceeds as usual.
Use Python to generate the configuration file, run the KITE executable on that file and run KITE-tools on the same file again:

``` bash
python config.py
../../build/KITEx config.h5
../../tools/build/KITE-tools config.h5
```

There is an extra flag in the configuration file `#!python custom_local_print=True`, which tells KITE to generate the
files `#!bash local_potentialX.dat`.
By default, this flag is set to `#!python False`.
These files contain the potential as a function of position for all the lattice points used by KITE (one file per thread).
These files can be further processed to generate a color plot of the potential for each orbital:

```
python3 test_potential.py
```

## 3. Finalizing
Due to the above, the default shared library used by KITE in `#!bash /lib` has been changed.
If the flag `#!python custom_local`" is unspecified, or set to `#!python False`, KITE will simply ignore this library,
but if it is set to `#!python True`, KITE will always use the shared library that was built in this example.
If the user wants to restore the original library, a backup should be used,
or the following three lines can be executed inside the `#!bash /lib` folder:

``` bash
g++ -Wall -fPIC -c aux.cpp 
g++ -shared -Wl,-soname,libaux.so.1 -o libaux.so aux.o
ln -sf libaux.so libaux.so.1
```
